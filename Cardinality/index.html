            Consent to act as a research subject</h1>
        <p> Edward Vul, Ph.D. is conducting a research study about mean position perception.
            You have been asked to participate because you are an undergraduate here at UCSD. <br><br>
            <b>PROCEDURES.</b> If you agree to participate in this study, the following will happen to you:<br>
            1. You will see a display of objects.<br>
            2. Your task is to estimate the average position of these objects.<br><br>
            <b>RISKS</b>. No potential risks or discomforts are anticipated except for the possibility that some tasks
            may be slightly boring.<br><br>
            PAYMENT/REMUNERATION<b></b>. In consideration of your time and inconvenience, you will receive half hour of
            course credit. The procedures and length of participation will last approximately 15-20 minutes.<br><br>
            <b>RIGHTS.</b> You may call the UCSD Human Research Protection Program at 858-657-5100 to ask about your
            rights as a research subject or to report research-related problems.<br><br>
            <b>BENEFITS</b>. There will be no direct benefit to you from these procedures. However, the investigator may
            learn more about basic questions pertaining to attention, memory, perception, cognition.<br><br>
            <b>EXPLANATION.</b> The researcher has explained this study to you and answered your questions. If you have
            questions or research related problems, you may reach Edward Vul at 858-534-4401.<br><br>
            <b>VOLUNTARY NATURE OF PARTICIPATION.</b> Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may refuse to
            participate or withdraw at any time without penalty.<br><br>
            <b>CONFIDENTIALITY.</b> Research records will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. As with all
            research, there is also the possibility of loss of confidentiality. Information from participants will be
            identified by a study number. The database which relates the study number to a specific subject will be
            maintained in the study coordinators office.<br><br>
            <b>COPY OF CONSENT.</b> You have received a copy of this consent document to keep and a copy of the
            Experimental Bill of Rights.

            You have unlimited attempts for your responses by clicking on a different estimated position as you wish. Finalize your decision by clicking the "SUBMIT" button.
